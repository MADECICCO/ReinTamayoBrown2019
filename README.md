You can either run the notebook on binder (click on the link above) or locally. If you want to run it locally you will need to install the latest version of [REBOUND](https://github.com/hannorein/rebound) as well as numpy, matplotlib, and jupyter. The easiest way to do this is by using `pip`:

```
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter rebound 
```

For more information on installing REBOUND see the [documentation](https://rebound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_quickstart.html).
